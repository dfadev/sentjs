# sentjs
Simple plaintext presentation tool.  Ported from [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/).

## Example:

Create an HTML file containing your presentation slides where each slide is separated by a blank line:
```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/sentjs">
@http://www.nyan.cat/cats/original.gif
this text will not be displayed, since the @ at the start of the first line
makes this paragraph an image slide.

Why?

get your point across fast

simple to use

2 slide types
🖹 Text
🌼 Image

built-in editor
⇒press escape

depends on
♽ HTML5
☢ CSS3
☃ JavaScript

usage:
\ 
<meta charset="utf-8">
<script src="http://unpkg.com/sentjs">
slide 1
\ 
slide 2
\ 
etc
<\/script>

one slide per paragraph

lines starting with # are ignored

image slide == paragraph containing @URL

empty slide == just use a \\ as a paragraph

Use \\<space> for a blank line in a slide

# This is a comment and will not be part of the presentation

# multiple empty lines between paragraphs are also ignored
